## Quick Start

npm start
npm run serve

This project has was made using this vuex4 and typeScript template from this gitHub link https://github.com/armanabkar/vue3-task-manager

it's not as pretty as I would liked it to be because I wanted to use vuetify, but it doesn't support vue3 without having to use vite, so I've decided to do it simple.

this app shows most of vue3 propertys and tools, so I hope it displays enough knowledge and maybe if someone random seys it, they could use it to learn from it.
